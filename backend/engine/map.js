 * This file manages the dungeon layout, room visibility, and navigation for the game.
 */

// Define the dungeon layout using a 2D array or grid structure.
// Create a function to generate or populate the map from a template or algorithm.
// Track room visibility using a mask or array that marks rooms as seen or explored.
// Include a function to mark rooms as discovered when the player enters or sees them.
// Export map-related functions for use by the state and executor modules.

// Create a function that handles player movement
// Take the current position and a direction
// Check if movement in that direction is possible
// Update the player's position if valid
// Mark newly discovered areas as explored
// Return the new position and description of the new location

// Create a function that manages map visibility
// Track which rooms the player has seen

// Support items that affect visibility (map, torch, magical sight)

// Create a function that describes the current location
// Generate detailed text for the player's current room
// Include exits, items, and entities present
// Adjust description based on room state or player actions
// Return formatted text for display

// Create utility functions for map queries
// Get all possible exits from current position
// Find path between two points
// Check if a position is valid and accessible
// Get all entities or items in a specified location

// Export the map-related functions
// These will be used by the executor and state modules
