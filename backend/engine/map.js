/**
 * Dungeon Map Generator (Structure Only)
 * 
 * This file defines the layout of rooms and hallways in the dungeon.
 * It is only responsible for generating and storing the structural map — 
 * no movement logic, no player interaction, and no room content exists here.
 * 
 * Each cell in the map represents a single space in the dungeon grid:
 * either a room, a hallway, or empty space. This structure will be used
 * later by other systems to manage navigation, description, and features.
 * 
 * This module exports a function that builds the layout and returns it
 * as a 2D array. Additional utility functions may be added if needed,
 * but no command processing or player logic should be included here.
 */

// Step 1: Define the dungeon grid size.
// - Choose a grid dimension (e.g., 10x10).
// - Create a 2D array to represent the map layout.
// - Fill the array with null, "empty", or placeholder values.

// Step 2: Choose a starting room.
// - Select a central or random location to place the initial room.
// - Store something like { type: "room" } in that cell.
// - Keep track of visited cells to avoid duplication during generation.

// Step 3: Expand the dungeon.
// - Write logic to add more rooms and hallways that are connected.
// - Each new room or hallway must attach to an existing one — never isolated.
// - You can choose random directions or follow a basic branching pattern.
// - Limit the number of rooms added (e.g., 8–12) to keep it manageable for now.

// Step 4: Return the map layout.
// - Once generation is complete, return the 2D array containing the room structure.
// - Later, this will be saved as part of the game state in `state.js`.

// Notes:
// - Room contents, features, descriptions, and interaction logic will be handled
//   by a separate system later in the project (using JSON templates).
// - Movement commands like "go north" will be defined elsewhere (likely under backend/engine/commands/).
// - This file should remain focused only on generating and representing the dungeon's physical layout.


// Placeholder function definition — implement following the steps above.

const mapGenerator = () => {
    // Build and return a 2D array of room/hallway layout.
};
