/**
 * Command Executor
 * 
 * This file applies parsed commands to the game state and returns results for the UI.
 */

// Import any necessary helper modules

// Create a function that receives a structured command object and the current game state.
// Validate whether the command is possible (e.g., is the item present, is the target visible, is the player able to act?).
// Apply the effects of the command to the game state (move player, update inventory, resolve combat, etc.).
// Advance the game time by the command's timeCost.
// Return the updated game state and a structured response object for the UI.

// Create handler functions for different command types
// Movement handler that changes player location
// Interaction handler for examining, taking, using items
// Combat handler for attack, defend, special abilities
// System handler for help, inventory, status commands
// Each handler should update the state and return appropriate messages

// Create a validation function that checks if a command can be executed
// Check if the player is in the right context (exploration vs combat)
// Check if the player has the required stats or equipment
// Check if the player's "readyAt" time has passed
// Return true if the command can proceed, or an error message if not

// Create a function that advances the game time
// Take the current state and a time cost in seconds
// Update the global game time
// Check for any time-triggered events that should occur
// Return the updated state

// Create a function that formats command responses
// Take the raw response data from a handler
// Format it into a consistent structure for the UI
// Include any state changes that the UI needs to know about
// Return a complete response object

// Export the main execution function for use by the engine
