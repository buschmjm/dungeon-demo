/**
 * Game State Manager
 * 
 * This file manages the central game state for the entire game session. All state changes must go through this module.
 */

// Define a central gameState object with properties for player, map, npcs, log, time, and any other core data.
// Create getter and setter-style functions to safely mutate the state (e.g., advanceTime, movePlayer, updateInventory).
// Only export controlled interfaces for interacting with the state. Do not export the raw gameState object directly.

// Create the main game state structure
// Use an object with separate sections for different aspects:
//   - player: stats, inventory, skills, position, readyAt timestamp
//   - world: map layout, active entities, items in rooms
//   - session: game time, turn counter, flags for completed events
//   - ui: currently visible information, available commands

// Create a function that initializes a new game state
// Set up default player stats and starting inventory
// Initialize an empty or starter dungeon map
// Set the game time to 0
// Return the complete state object

// Create functions to safely modify player state
// Add/remove inventory items
// Change stats like health or experience
// Update position when moving
// Set the player's "readyAt" timestamp when taking actions

// Create functions to safely modify world state
// Add/remove entities from rooms
// Update entity states (like monster health)
// Change room descriptions or properties
// Handle environment effects (traps, hazards)

// Create functions to manage game time
// Advance the global clock
// Check which entities are ready to act
// Trigger time-based events when appropriate

// Create utility functions for common state queries
// Check if player can see a particular room
// Check if player meets requirements for actions
// Get all items in current location
// Get all active threats or entities

// Create a function that returns a safe copy of the state
// This should hide information the player shouldn't know
// It might create a deep copy to prevent accidental modification
// It should only expose what the UI needs to display

// Export the state management functions
// Do not export the raw state object directly
