/**
 * Main Game Launcher
 * 
 * This is your game's entry point - the first code that runs when someone starts playing.
 * Let's set up a clean launcher that connects your engine to the outside world!
 */

/*
First, let's get organized. This file should remain lightweight - it's just a bridge
between the engine and your frontend interface.

Start by importing your engine:
- Import the engine module you've created
- You'll want to use ES modules syntax for clean dependency management
- Decide whether to import specific functions or the entire engine API

Next, set up your game configuration:
- Create an object to store initial game parameters 
- Include settings like difficulty level or starting location
- Think about which settings should be changeable at runtime vs. fixed at startup

Then, initialize your game world:
- Call the engine's initialization function
- Pass along any necessary configuration
- Handle or display any startup messages for the player

Once the game is running, establish communication patterns:
- Set up event handlers or methods to capture UI interactions
- Create a pipeline for sending commands from UI to engine
- Determine how game state updates will flow back to the UI

Finally, make certain features accessible to the outside world:
- Export functions for saving and loading games
- Provide ways to reset or restart the game
- Include methods that let the UI query important game state

This launcher is your game's foundation - keep it focused on connecting components
rather than implementing game logic. The cleaner this interface is, the easier 
it will be to swap out UI components or add new features later.
